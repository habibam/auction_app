An application where a user can log in and register (fully equipped with authentication as well as password hashing).

Once in the dashboard, a user can add an item to auction and bid on other items as well. The user has a wallet amount that is limited, they cannot buy and bid on items for more than what is available to them. The highest bid under an item is sorted and brought the top. Once an auction ends, the item is removed from the dashboard and the user with the highest bid wins the item. If a user wins an item, they price for the item is removed from their wallet and the sellerâ€™s wallet increases by the dollar amount they sold the item for.
